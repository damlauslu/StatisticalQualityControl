The project is aligned with the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) structure and follows the statistical quality control principles outlined by Montgomery (7th Edition).\n",

    "## 1.1 What is Statistical Quality Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Quality Control (SQC) refers to the use of statistical techniques to control and improve production processes. It includes control charts, process capability analysis, and acceptance sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of variation in processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chance Causes (Common Causes)**: Random variation inherent in the process.\n",
    "- **Assignable Causes (Special Causes)**: Identifiable sources of variation that can be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process is said to be *in control* if only chance causes are present and *out of control* if assignable causes are also affecting the output.\n",
